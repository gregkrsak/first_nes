Quick Start
===========

Linux:
------

First, assuming you have Git installed, get the cc65 binutils:

```
git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
cd cc65
make
sudo make avail
```


Next, if you don't already have an NES emulator, install Nestopia using your package manager. Instructions
on how to do that aren't covered here, but the following distros *should* be supported:

- Arch Linux
- Debian
- OpenBSD
- Rosa Desktop Fresh
- Slackware (Slackbuilds)
- Ubuntu
- Void Linux


Now grab the first_nes project:

```
git clone https://github.com/gregkrsak/first_nes
cd first_nes
make
```


Finally, start Nestopia and load the generated ```first_nes.nes``` file. You can move the Luigi-like character back and forth with the A and B controller buttons, which may be mapped to the ```.``` and ```,``` keys initially.


Mac OS:
-------

First, get the cc65 binutils by following [these instructions](http://macappstore.org/cc65/) (alternatively, if you have ```brew``` installed, type ```brew install cc65```).


Next, if you don't already have an NES emulator, install the [Nestopia .app](http://www.bannister.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi?nestopia) on your system.


Now, assuming you have Git installed, and the ability to ```make```, grab the first_nes project using the Terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/gregkrsak/first_nes
cd first_nes
make
```


Finally, start Nestopia and load the generated ```first_nes.nes``` file. You can move the Luigi-like character back and forth with the A and B controller buttons, which may be mapped to the ```.``` and ```,``` keys initially.


Windows:
--------

First, make sure you have Git and Git Bash. If you don't, click [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to download the latest .EXE installer; make sure you install the Git Bash terminal.


After Git is installed, open Git Bash and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/gregkrsak/first_nes.git
```


Next download the cc65 binutils. Click [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cc65/files/latest/download) to download the .ZIP file.


Create a folder named "cc65" and extract the .ZIP file into it.


A "bin" subfolder will be created; add it to your system path.


Next, if you don't already have an NES emulator, click [this link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nestopiaue/files/1.48/nestopia_1.48-win32.zip/download) to download the .ZIP archive of Nestopia.


To make sure Nestopia installs correctly, create a "nestopia" folder and extract the .ZIP file to it; make sure you add this "nestopia" folder to your system path.


Nestopia needs the Microsoft Direct X End User Runtime, which you can install using [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35).


Now, install the Make utility using [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81.exe/download?use_mirror=iweb&download=).


Following the installation of Make, add its "bin" subfolder to your system path.


Navigate to the "first_nes" folder using Git Bash and type ```make```.


Finally, start Nestopia and load the generated ```first_nes.nes``` file. You can move the Luigi-like character back and forth with the A and B controller buttons, which may be mapped to the ```.``` and ```,``` keys initially.
